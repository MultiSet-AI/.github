# Multiset AI

Multiset AI provides a Visual Positioning System (VPS) designed to power large-scale, location-aware applications on any device. [1] It offers a developer platform that includes tools for 3D mapping and a state-of-the-art VPS SDK. [1, 2]

## What is Multiset?

Multiset AI delivers a high-speed, 6-DOF localization solution with sub-6-centimeter accuracy. [1] It is built to perform reliably in a variety of challenging conditions, including dynamic indoor and outdoor spaces, low-light environments, and multi-floor structures with high interference. [1] The Augmented Reality Enterprise Alliance (AREA) has recognized it as the leading Enterprise VPS for its exceptional performance in localization accuracy and indoor positioning. [1]

## Key Features

*   **Cross-Platform SDK:** A unified SDK is available for iOS, Android, Meta Quest, WebXR, and ROS 2. [2]
*   **Precise 6-DoF Localization:** Achieves centimeter-level accuracy and maintains stable tracking even when users tilt, rotate, or switch between sensors. [1]
*   **Instant-Launch Experiences:** Supports WebXR and iOS App Clips, enabling users to launch spatial experiences from a QR code without installing an application first. [1]
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Offers multiple deployment options, including self-hosted, public cloud, private cloud, and on-device solutions. [1]
*   **Scalable Mapping (MapSet):** Fuses multiple scans from various sources into a single, continuous coordinate system to eliminate "map islands" and allow seamless navigation across large areas. [1]
*   **Developer Toolkit and Open APIs:** Provides sample scenes, a REST endpoint for streaming 6-DoF data, and GraphQL for map management. [2]
